# Breast Cancer Dataset

In Breast Cancer dataset we classify tumors into malignant (cancerous) or benign (non-cancerous)

Since it is a classification problem I have made use of the following Machine Learning models for the datatset i.e  
> 1. Support Vector Machine - Accuracy 94%
> 2. Decision Tree Classification - Accuracy 96%
